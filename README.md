# Fraud-detection-model

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. The model leverages advanced classification techniques to identify potentially suspicious behavior in transaction datasets. The project follows a comprehensive pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, to achieve reliable fraud detection results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The model focuses on achieving a balance between precision and recall due to the class imbalance typically seen in fraud datasets.
